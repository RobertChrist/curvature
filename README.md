#If you are looking for the active Node JS port, please switch to 

[branch Port/Language_NodeJS, available here](https://github.com/RobertChrist/curvature/tree/Port/Language_NodeJs)

-----

This branch is a backup of my original work porting curvature.py to Node.Js, before rebasing prior to issuing a pull request.

It will likely be deleted in the near future.
